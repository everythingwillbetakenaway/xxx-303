// This is a conversion table of bpms to micro intervals. Maybe do like 60bpm-170bpm only.
// A math function would be nice here, but the nanos vary too much between bpms
// Distance between nanos seem to be 145-165.
// This should be tediously expanded to at least another decimal spot, then made into a table, and moved to progmem.
